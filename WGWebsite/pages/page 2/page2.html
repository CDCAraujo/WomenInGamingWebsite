        DIFDICULTIES WOMEN FACE IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY <br />
        <br />
        In times past, gaming was a novelty reserved for masculine and
        tech-savvy men, however the online gaming industry is witnessing the
        number of women players growing steadily on both consumer and developer
        level. Despite not falling short of their male counter parts, this does
        not mean female gamers are overtly welcomed with open hands, there are
        quite a few serious issues every female gamer has dealt with. From
        sexual harassment to sexism, there is also the issue of gender pay gap
        and the ignorance of women as a target group of the gaming industry.
        These and many others pose issues that need to be addressed and
        communities where women feel safe and welcome are a necessity. Times are
        changing though, be part of the change and help us spread awareness and
        fight these issues!
