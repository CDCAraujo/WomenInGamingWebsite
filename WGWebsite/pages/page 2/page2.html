        GAMING ISN'T JUST FOR BOYS! <br />
        <br />
        The gaming industry has changed significantly since it first began in the late 1950's, with Physicist William Higinbotham's <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200810/physicshistory.cfm" target="_blank">Tennis for Two. </a> Gaming has gone through many different changes since then. Initially marketed at just boys, it was difficult for women and girls to break into the industry, whether playing, or joining a career. Many barriers have xisted historically for women and girls in the industry, and many are still being fought against today. Changes in marketing strategies, as well as societal changes, have increased the numbers of women and girls in the industry, but much more change is needed before we can see real equality in the industry. 
        <br />An important element in this change has been the growth of women in streaming, and these women speaking out on their experiences in the industry. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pokimane raised awareness of the <a href="https://win.gg/news/pokimane-discusses-sexism-on-twitch-diversity-on-the-platform/"> double standards in the streaming industry,</a> as well as the <a href="https://win.gg/news/pokimane-speaks-on-sexism-regarding-female-streamers-looks/"> vitriol female streamers recieve regarding their looks.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Amouranth spoke up about the objectification of girls and women from even as young as <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/amouranth-interview-objectification/"> childhood.</a> She also spoke up about the dangers women and girls can face from simply <a href="https://win.gg/news/amouranth-speaks-out-on-sexist-business-parter-spars-on-twitter/"> declining an invitation from a man </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Scottish streamers speak up about <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/what-its-really-like-to-be-a-female-twitch-streamer-and-why-its-far-from-game-over-for-misogyny-in-the-gaming-industry-3337578">misogyny in the industry </a> and how they fight against it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>Speaking up about these issues is incedibly important in introducing change, and in encouraging other women to speak out and get involved!
