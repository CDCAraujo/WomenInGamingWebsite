        <header>HOW THE INDUSTRY IS CHANGING</header>
        <br />
        The gaming industry has changed significantly since it first began in the late 1950's, with Physicist William Higinbotham's <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200810/physicshistory.cfm" target="_blank">Tennis for Two. </a> Gaming has gone through many different changes since then. Initially marketed at just boys, it was difficult for women and girls to break into the industry, whether playing, or joining a career. Many barriers have xisted historically for women and girls in the industry, and many are still being fought against today. Changes in marketing strategies, as well as societal changes, have increased the numbers of women and girls in the industry, but much more change is needed before we can see real equality in the industry. 
        <br />An important element in this change has been the growth of women in streaming, and these women speaking out on their experiences in the industry. 
        <ul>
            <li>
                Pokimane raised awareness of the <a href="https://win.gg/news/pokimane-discusses-sexism-on-twitch-diversity-on-the-platform/"> double standards in the streaming industry,</a> as well as the <a href="https://win.gg/news/pokimane-speaks-on-sexism-regarding-female-streamers-looks/"> vitriol female streamers recieve regarding their looks.</a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Amouranth spoke up about the objectification of girls and women from even as young as <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/amouranth-interview-objectification/"> childhood.</a> She also spoke up about the dangers women and girls can face from simply <a href="https://win.gg/news/amouranth-speaks-out-on-sexist-business-parter-spars-on-twitter/"> declining an invitation from a man </a>
            </li>
            <li>
                Scottish streamers speak up about <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/people/what-its-really-like-to-be-a-female-twitch-streamer-and-why-its-far-from-game-over-for-misogyny-in-the-gaming-industry-3337578">misogyny in the industry </a> and how they fight against it.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <br>Speaking up about these issues is incedibly important in introducing change, and in encouraging other women to speak out and get involved!

        <header>DIFFICULTIES WOMEN FACE IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY</header>
        <p>
          In times past, gaming was a novelty reserved for masculine and
          tech-savvy men, however the online gaming industry is witnessing the
          number of women players growing steadily on both consumer and developer
          level. <br>
          Despite not falling short of their male counter parts, this does
          not mean female gamers are overtly welcomed with open hands, there are
          quite a few serious issues every female gamer has dealt with. <br>
          From
          sexual harassment to sexism, there is also the issue of gender pay gap
          and the ignorance of women as a target group of the gaming industry.<br>
          Recently one of the biggest <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2022/10/13/activision-blizzard-is-once-again-being-sued-for-sexual-harassment/?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAGsypVsBQnlf3gVP75JXOp_7Vv4v_MCDGvPjikoLIQzn93Xo7fFOYhGhQ6o5gAkeMWwiQhYSkuMStLZxPedVIAjIEBhxnU0A_x-gZwXgX5oVdbjj-sZCvZgSvXczkOM2S4j1g8A1CjUzMCY_fyt2uRuUeaINBguclxNfSqbEFWxO">gaming companies was sued after a an extreme case of sexual harrasement came to light.</a> Many players stopped playing famous games like World of Warcraft in protest and to show support to the victims.
          These and many others pose issues that need to be addressed and
          communities where women feel safe and welcome are a necessity. <br>
          <br>
          Times are
          changing though, be part of the change and help us spread awareness and
          fight these issues!

      <div class="Disclaimer">
        <p>As you may see above, this industry is massive. However, as a form of disclaimer, the author would like to caution you, dear reader, that the UN study used as a source of the above visual, should you like to read it yourself, has deep flaws, such as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of the broadest possible definition of 'gamer', casting a wide net.</li>
            <li>Use of the above to try their hardest at finding what the report was set to find</li>
            <li>Their sample size used in their inquiries is NOT representative of the global audience.<br>>Specifically, their female percentile in the sample group is a mere 15%</li>
            <li>Arguably malicious, censorious intent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that's largely unimportant for the topic at hand, only relevant if you, dear reader, decide to dive into the report.</p>

      <div class="GamerDemographics">
        <h2>Overal Audience Demographics</h2>
        <p>An important thing to keep in mind, I would argue, is to know exactly <i>who</i> plays <i>what,</i> and to this end, I present you the following graph breaking down the demographics of the medium's audience (coloquialy, gamers), by both gender and genre.</p>

        <br>
        <p>It bears pointing out that most gamers play a variety of games across genres, and a high participation rate in the chart doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that gamers (whether male or female) only play that particular genre.<br>The source itself goes into a <i>lot</i> more detail than what I'll present here, but should you have interest, by all means, it's a well structured and thought out post!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="DeveloperDemographics">
        <h2>Overal Developer Demographics</h2>
        <p>That's a lot of stuff about the market's consumers, but that's not all the gaming industry is. The other important faced of it is it's developers, the ones coding (and unfortunately many times crunching) up the works of art and entertainment we all love, often times in spite of publisher meddling or corporate greed.</p>

        <p>I believe it's worth noting that while I have scoured the web, I've had trouble finding data including the current year of 2022, and thus decided limit these stats to the previous year of 2021 due to the greater wealth of data to source and corroborate.</p>
