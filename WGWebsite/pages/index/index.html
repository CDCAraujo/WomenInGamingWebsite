        <header>HOW THE INDUSTRY IS CHANGING</header>
        <br />
        The gaming industry has changed significantly since it first began in the late 1950's, with Physicist William Higinbotham's <a href="https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200810/physicshistory.cfm" target="_blank">Tennis for Two. </a> Gaming has gone through many different changes since then. Initially marketed at just boys, it was difficult for women and girls to break into the industry, whether playing, or joining a career. Many barriers have xisted historically for women and girls in the industry, and many are still being fought against today. Changes in marketing strategies, as well as societal changes, have increased the numbers of women and girls in the industry, but much more change is needed before we can see real equality in the industry. 
        <br />An important element in this change has been the growth of women in streaming, and these women speaking out on their experiences in the industry.

        <header>DIFFICULTIES WOMEN FACE IN THE GAMING INDUSTRY</header>
        <p>
          In times past, gaming was a novelty reserved for masculine and
          tech-savvy men, however the online gaming industry is witnessing the
          number of women players growing steadily on both consumer and developer
          level. <br>
          Despite not falling short of their male counter parts, this does
          not mean female gamers are overtly welcomed with open hands, there are
          quite a few serious issues every female gamer has dealt with. <br>
          From
          sexual harassment to sexism, there is also the issue of gender pay gap
          and the ignorance of women as a target group of the gaming industry.
          These and many others pose issues that need to be addressed and
          communities where women feel safe and welcome are a necessity. <br>
          <br>
          Times are
          changing though, be part of the change and help us spread awareness and
          fight these issues!
