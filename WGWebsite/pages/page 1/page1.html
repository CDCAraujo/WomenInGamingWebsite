<!--I've been racking my brain on how to make the Disclaimer a button you click to open a text box, but unfortunately I'm coming up short.-->
    <div class="Disclaimer">
        <p>As you may see above, this industry is massive. However, as a form of disclaimer, the author would like to caution you, dear reader, that the UN study used as a source of the above visual, should you like to read it yourself, has deep flaws, such as: </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use of the broadest possible definition of 'gamer', casting a wide net.</li>
            <li>Use of the above to try their hardest at finding what the report was set to find</li>
            <li>Their sample size used in their inquiries is NOT representative of the global audience.<br>>Specifically, their female percentile in the sample group is a mere 15%</li>
            <li>Arguably malicious, censorious intent.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>But that's largely unimportant for the topic at hand, only relevant if you, dear reader, decide to dive into the report.</p>

    <div class="GamerDemographics">
        <h2>Overal Audience Demographics</h2>
        <p>An important thing to keep in mind, I would argue, is to know exactly <i>who</i> plays <i>what,</i> and to this end, I present you the following graph breaking down the demographics of the medium's audience (coloquialy, gamers), by both gender and genre.</p>

        </div>
        <br>
        <p>It bears pointing out that most gamers play a variety of games across genres, and a high participation rate in the chart doesnâ€™t necessarily mean that gamers (whether male or female) only play that particular genre.<br>The source itself goes into a <i>lot</i> more detail than what I'll present here, but should you have interest, by all means, it's a well structured and thought out post!</p>
    </div>

    <div class="DeveloperDemographics">
        <h2>Overal Developer Demographics</h2>
        <p>That's a lot of stuff about the market's consumers, but that's not all the gaming industry is. The other important faced of it is it's developers, the ones coding (and unfortunately many times crunching) up the works of art and entertainment we all love, often times in spite of publisher meddling or corporate greed.</p>

        <p>I believe it's worth noting that while I have scoured the web, I've had trouble finding data including the current year of 2022, and thus decided limit these stats to the previous year of 2021 due to the greater wealth of data to source and corroborate.</p>
